        <h2>Interactive Map of Ambulance Station and Population (2001-2024)</h2>
        <p class="card-note">This interactive map combines Australia's population distribution and the location of ambulance stations to reveal how
          emergency service accessibility aligns with population density across different regions. In the eastern and western coastal areas, where population density is higher, 
          ambulance stations are more concentrated to ensure prompt emergency response. In contrast, the vast interior regions with lower population densities have fewer ambulance 
          stations, highlighting the challenges of providing emergency services in remote areas. The map emphasises the importance of strategic placement of ambulance stations to 
          effectively serve Australia's diverse population distribution by enabling users to explore different years and observe changes over time.

        <h2>Age Composition(%) by State</h2>
        <p class="card-note">The line chart compares each state's age distribution for selected year. Each line represents a specific age group percentage
          of the population within that state, revealing demographic trends and variations across different regions. Notice how state like Tasmania and South 
          Australia have higher proportions of older age groups (45+) compared to states like Northern Territory and ACT, which have a larger share 
          of younger populations (&lt;45). This information is crucial for ambulance service planning, as different age groups may have varying healthcare needs and emergency response requirements.

        <h2>Population and Ambulance Station Count by State</h2>
        <p class="card-note">The bar chart compares each Australia state's total population with its numeber of ambulance stations in 2024, 
          visualising the relationship between population size and emergency service infrastructure. States with larger populations, such as New South Wales and Victoria,
          tend to have more ambulance stations to meet the higher demand for emergency services. Conversely, less populous states like Tasmania and the Northern Territory
          have fewer ambulance stations. This comparison highlights the importance of aligning ambulance station distribution with population density to ensure effective emergency response across Australia.
